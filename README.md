# Breakout Game

## Overview

This project is a simple Python-based implementation of the classic arcade game "Breakout". The game is built using the Turtle Graphics library. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and aims to destroy all the blocks by hitting them with a ball.

## Features

- **Graphics**: Utilizes Turtle Graphics for rendering the game elements.
- **Control**: Players can move the paddle left and right using keyboard inputs.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded for each block destroyed.
- **Game Mechanics**: The ball bounces off the walls, paddle, and blocks, with different responses upon collision.
- **Difficulty**: The speed of the ball increases slightly each time it hits a block, making the game progressively harder.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Download the project files to a local directory.
3. Run the game using a Python interpreter.

## How to Play

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
- The goal is to break all the blocks without letting the ball fall below the paddle.
- The game ends when all blocks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.

## Game Components

- **Paddle**: The player-controlled object used to bounce the ball upwards.
- **Ball**: Bounces off the paddle, walls, and blocks.
- **Blocks**: Arranged in rows at the top, which the player aims to destroy.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the current score.
